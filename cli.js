/* write a CLI interface for the "replace" function and your files

  command line arguments:
    1: the file you want to read from
    2: the old string to replace
    3: the new string to replace it with
    4: the file you want to write to

  examples:
  $ node cli.js the-book-of-sand.txt the any sand-the-any.txt
  $ node cli.js the-library-of-babel.txt f g library-f-g.txt

  behavior:
  : parse command line arguments from process.argv
    (let the user know if they are missing any arguments!)
  : read from the selected file in the './files' directory
  : use your logic function to create the new text
  : write to the new file
  : console.log a nice message letting the user know what happened

  little challenges:
  : -help
    if a user passes in "-help" as any command line argument,
    log a little description of how the CLI works
  : -list
    if a user passes in "-list" as any command line argument,
    log a list of all the file names in "./files"
